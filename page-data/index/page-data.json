It also\nwould often need deep knowledge of Maximo apis as well as the Maximo internals. That can often be a daunting task even for an experienced\nprogrammer.\n\nMaximo scripting helps ease some of these concerns. Maximo scripting is primarily based on the JSR 223 specification which is part of JAVA 6.\nThis JSR allows a JAVA application [in this case Maximo] to host script engines which are compliant to this specification. The engines that are supported in an\nOOTB Maximo are\n\n\n|Script Languages|\n|:-------------------------------|\n|Nashorn (JavaScript) which ships with the IBM/Oracle JDK|\n|Jython (2.7.2) which is included as part of Maximo|\n\n\nThis implies that users can use either of these 2 scripting languages to customize Maximo using the Maximo scripting framework. We do understand\nthat there are other popular JSR 223 compliant scripting engines like JRuby/Groovy and it should be fairly simple to add support for these by adding\nthese engines [jars] in Maximo application classpath. The way the scripting framework is written – it should be able to detect those jars from the classpath\nand show them as available languages in the scripting application. However we would like to mention that at this point Maximo has only been tested with the\nNashorn-JavaScript and Jython engines and some of those JSR223 compliant engines may have potential issues with their implementation which\ncan prevent seamless integration with Maximo.\n\n\nIn addition to the JSR 223 compliant engines, the scripting framework is extensible to support other custom engines - as apparent from the architecture diagram below.\n\n\n![Script Driver architecture](scriptdriverarch.jpg)\n\n\nIn here you will see that we support MBR (**M**aximo **B**usiness **R**ules) script driver which can invoke MBR scripts. This is a non-JSR driver writtent to handle a custom scripting language (MBR) \ncreated just for Maximo. This just shows the extensibility of the framework.\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ae1ae70016b313a9eb2f823f4af78d84","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":147},"frontmatter":{"title":"Maximo Scripting"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Maximo Scripting\n---\n\nimport HomepageTemplate from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Homepage';\nexport default HomepageTemplate;\n\n## Learn all about Maximo Scripting\n\nScripting was introduced in Maximo version 7.5 based on the feedback from the user community who yearned to have a simpler yet\neffective way of customizing the product without having to go through the pain of system downtime and steep learning curve.\n\nWhile Maximo provides great many customization points, most of them needs JAVA coding skills to do any meaningful [logic based] customization.

The root url for that api is\n\n```\nGET /maximo/oslc\n```\n\nAnd then you can dive deeper into each server (cluster members) using the /oslc/members api.\nWe provide a bunch of apis that can help you introspect the servers. But of course we do not\nhave all the apis that you will ever need. Fortunately there is a easy way to dynamically add\nthese apis using automation scripts. Below I will provide a sample use case (a real one) that\nneeded us to leverage that feature. Say you need to find out the servers locale as you trying to\ndebug some locale related issue. You can quickly write up a automation script and serve it up\nas an MMI api using the MMI app - available from the Logging app action in Maximo - Monitor\nEnvironment Information. One of the cool aspects of MMI apis being - it gets distributed in every\nmember server and using the MMI api framework - one can invoke these scripted apilets on\neach server. The sample script would look like below:\n\n\n```python\nfrom java.util import Locale\nbr.setProperty(\"syslocale\",Locale.getDefault().toString())\n```\n\nLets name it SYSTEMLOCALE. Note the usage of the implict variable \"br\" that has apis like\nsetProperty(propname,propvalue) and getProperty(propName). The script figures out the \nsystem default locale and sets it to the br with a property name of “syslocale”.

The following root URL is for that API:\n\n```\nGET /maximo/oslc\n```\n\nYou can dive deeper into each server (cluster members) using the /oslc/members API.\nMultiple APIs can help you introspect the servers. However, you may not find all the APIs that you require. Fortunately, there is a easy way to dynamically add\nthese APIs using automation scripts. The following sample use case will demonstrate how to leverage that feature. For example, you need to find out the servers locale as you are trying to\ndebug some locale related issue. You can quickly write up an automation script and serve it up\nas an MMI API using the MMI app, which is available from the **Logging** app action in Maximo - Monitor\nEnvironment Information. One of the cool aspects of MMI APIs is that they get distributed in every\nmember server and you can use the MMI API framework to invoke these scripted apilets on\neach server.

The implicit variable \"br\" has APIs like\nsetProperty(propname,propvalue) and getProperty(propName).

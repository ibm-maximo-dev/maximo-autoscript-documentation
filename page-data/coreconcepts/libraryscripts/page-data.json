Frpm Maximo 76 onwards, we can write those reusable blocks into as \nlibrary scripts which are just simple scripts with no launchpoints. We can then leverage the `service` variable to invoke those library scipts from another script. \nNote that Library scripts have undergone some improvements over the last few releases and the section below will discuss both the old way and new way of leveraging those.\nBelow we will use a simple example to showcase the change in usage\n\n```python\nr=a*b\n```\n\nAs apparent this is a script that multiplies 2 variables - `a` and `b` and sets the result to another variable `r`.\nAssume that we are invoking this script from another script and we want to pass in `a` and `b` and then get the `r` value back.\nThe script below shows a sample that calls this library script (named CALC):\n\n```python\nfrom java.util import HashMap\n\nmap = HashMap()\nmap.put(\"a\",2)\nmap.put(\"b\",3)\nservice.invokeScript(\"CALC\",map)\nres = map.get(\"r\")\n```\n\nAs you can see, the calling script leverages the implicit `service` variable (available to all scripts) toinvoke the library script named CALC. \nIt also passes in the `a` and `b` as a Map object to the script.

The autoscript application can be launched from the GoTo → System\nConfiguration → Autoscript menu. In the list tab drop down actions list there are a bunch of wizards that lets you\n\n\n|Script Wizards|\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Create a vanilla script without any launch point.|\n|Create Scripts with Object launch point.|\n|Create Scripts with Attribute launch point.|\n|Create Scripts with Action launch point.|\n|Create scripts with custom condition launch point.|\n|Create scripts for Integration.|\n\nThese wizards will drive you through the process of creating a script and optionally associating launch points with it. We will discuss launch points in details in a later\nsection.\n\n## Script/Launch point maintenance\nAfter the script and launch point have been created – users can come to the autoscript application for maintenance. This can be done using the\nmain/variables/launch point tabs in that application. One can modify the script, add or update the variables and their bindings as well as the bindings in the\nlaunch point level [if they are overridable]. Deletion of variables are not allowed unless none of the launch points refer to that variable.\n\n## Variables and Bindings\nNext in line are the variables and their bindings. Variables are what the scripts use to interact with Maximo. \nVariables can be IN, INOUT or OUT. These follow the classical defintion of IN- pass by value, INOUT/OUT – passed by reference. \nThe script can modify only the INOUT and OUT type of variables. \nModification of IN variables in the script has no impact outside the script. \nVariables can be bound to a Maximo artifact like a mbo attribute, a maxvar, a maximo system property or \ncan be bound to a literal value which does not tie back to any Maximo artifact. \nNote variables bound to a maxvar or a system property are of type IN only as they cannot be modified by the script. \nVariable data type for mbo attributes is driven by the mbo attribute datatype. \nSo for example a variable bound to Purchase Order mbos totalcost attribute will inherit its type ie a double. \nVariables bound to maxvar and system properties are always of type String. \nVariables bound to literal values can define their datatype explicitly by setting “literaldatatype” attribute in the autoscriptvars \ntable. The supported literal data types are – ALN, INTEGER, SMALLINT, DECIMAL, YORN, DATETIME and FLOAT. \nVariable bindings can be defined both at the script level and the launchpoint level - provided the definition at the script level \nallows override of that value (at the launchpoint level). More about this on the Launchpoints section. \nOne other important aspect of the OUT and INOUT variables is how their values can be set back to the Mbos. The below screenshot and table explains those settings.\nMbo attributes can be set with the NOACTION flag which determines if modifying the value of the mbo attribute will cause the field validations action routine to be called or not. \nMbo attributes can be set with the NOVALIDATION flag which determines if modifying the value of the mbo attribute will cause the field validations validate routine to be called or not. \nMbo atributes can be set using NOACCESSCHECK flags which determine if the Action/Validation routine of the mbo attributes will get called or not. \nA mbo attribute can be set with any combination of these flags. All these can be done from the script/launch point creation wizards and maintenance application by selecting those [checkbox] options.\n\n\n![Attribute Metadata](attrmeta.jpg)  \n\n\nThe table below explains their usage:  \n\n\n|Binding Metadata|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|Suppress Validation|Boolean|Mbo attributes will be set with the NOVALIDATION flag which determines if modifying the value of the mbo attribute will cause the field validations validate routine to be called (false) or not (true).|For attribute bindings|\n|Suppress Action|Boolean|Mbo attributes will be set with the NOACTION flag which determines if modifying the value of the mbo attribute will cause the field validations action routine to be called (false) or not (true).|For attribute bindings|\n|Suppress Access Control|Boolean|Mbo attributes will be set with the NOACCESSCHECK flag which determines if the mbo attribute value can be modified irrespective of whether the attribute is readonly (true) or not (true/false).|For attribute bindings|\n\n\n## Implicit and Explicit Variables\nAnother important feature is the concept of Implicit and Explicit variables.\nExplicit variables are what we just read about – the ones that you define and\nbind in the variables page explicitly. Implicit variables are the ones that you do\nnot define in that page and are provided to you behind the scenes by the\nframework. Implicits follow the convention over configuration pattern where the\nframework will intelligently inject variables at run-time which might otherwise\nwould have needed JAVA coding to fetch/set. Some of the implicits are injected\nbased on the explicit variables defined and some are injected irrespective of\nthem. Lets cover the ones that are injected irrespective of the explicit variables\nfirst. The list of them is as below with a little blurb describing what they are for.\n\n|Name|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|app|String|Name of the Maximo application which initiated the script execution.|All launch points dealing with a mbo or mboset|\n|user|String|`userid` of the user whose action initiated the script execution.|All launch points dealing with a mbo or mboset|\n|mbo|psdi.mbo.Mbo|The current mbo in the context of the script execution.

There are no implicit variables for explicitly defined variables of other\nbinding types like – Literals, Maxvars and System properties. Below is the list of the implicit variables. Assume “var” \nis the explicitly defined variable that binds to a mbo attribute.\n\n\n|Name|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|var_required|boolean|Required flag of the mbo attribute that var binds to.|All launch points.

The script cannot modify it.|\n\n\n## Launchpoints and Callbacks\n**Launchpoints** are what we call the application customization points.\nLaunchpoints define which application artifact the user wants to customize by\nattaching the script to that point. In effect the script is executed [launched] in the\ncontext of a launchpoint. For example if the user wants to customize the Asset\nmbos initialization routine the key words Asset mbo & initialization routine\ndefines that launchpoint. Another example might be that the user wants to\ncustomize the Asset mbo's purchaseprice attribute's field validation routine. Here\nthe key words that define the launchpoint are - Asset mbo, purchaseprice\nattribute and field validation routine. So in effect a launchpoint is a\nconfiguration to identify what application point we are trying to customize. A\nscript can be associated with 1 or more launchpoint at the same time. For\nexample a generic site level validation script can be associated with all site level\nobjects in Maximo – where each association is defined as an individual\nlaunchpoint. A script can be associated with launchpoints of the one and only\none type. For example a script associated with the Object launch point cannot be\nassociated again with another attribute launch point. Once the first association is\ndone between a script and a launch point – all subsequent launch points have to\nbe of the same type as the first one.\n\nNow lets take a look at the launchpoints [aka customization points] covered\nby the scripting framework. Below is the list of the points supported currently.\n\n1. Mbo initialization and save point logic [aka Object launchpoint].\n2. Mbo attribute value modification – validation and action logic [aka Object\nattribute launchpoint].\n3. Actions – which are used by a multitude of other components like\nWorkflow, Escalation, UI Menu, UI Buttons [aka Action launchpoint].\n4. Custom conditions – used by Workflow conditions, Conditional UI etc\n[aka custom condition launchpoint].\n\nLaunchpoints and callbacks are what you think of first when you want to customize an\napplication.\n\n\n## Activating and Deactivating scripts\n\nScripts can be activated or deactivated from the launchpoint tab of the scripting\napplication or from the Script main page. The deactivation from the Script main will deactivate the script for all launchpoints of that script. \nDeactivating from launchpoint only deactivates that launchpoint for the script. All other active launchpoints should continue working as is.\n\n\nA script that is deactivated will not be invoked by Maximo. For example if a Attribute Launch point is deactivated – the script for that launchpoint\nwill not be invoked when say the value of that mbo attribute changes. This is a very useful tool for debugging when you run into some trouble with the\napplication behaviour and want to take the script out of the equation temporarily just to test the vanilla application devoid of all the customization. One thing to\nnote here is the autoscript status attribute value has no significance as to how the scripting framework will [or will not] invoke the script.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d4a9b1d13fa26755216b28a6b804ace8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":161},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scripting Artifacts"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Scripting Artifacts\n---\n\n## Script/Launch point Creation\nThis is done via wizards launched from the list tab in the autoscript application.

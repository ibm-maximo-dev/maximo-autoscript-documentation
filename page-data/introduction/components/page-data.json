You can launch the Automation Script application from the **GoTo → System\nConfiguration → Autoscript** menu. In the **List** tab drop down actions list, you can see the following wizards: \n\n\n|Script wizards|\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Create a vanilla script without any launch point.|\n|Create scripts with Object launch point.|\n|Create scripts with Attribute launch point.|\n|Create scripts with Action launch point.|\n|Create scripts with custom condition launch point.|\n|Create scripts for Integration.|\n\nThese wizards will guide you through the process of creating a script and optionally associating launch points with it. Launch points are discussed in detail in a later section.\n\n## Script and launch point maintenance\nAfter the script and launch point has been created, you can use the Automation Script application for maintenance. Maintenance can be done using the\n**Main, Variables, Launch point** tabs in the Automation Script application. You can add or update the variables and their bindings as well as the bindings at the\nlaunch point level, if they are overridable. You cannot delete variables unless none of the launch points refer to that variable.\n\n## Variables and bindings\nScripts use variables to interact with Maximo. \nVariables are either IN, INOUT, or OUT. These variables follow the classical definition where IN is the pass-by-value, and INOUT and OUT are passed by reference. \nThe script can modify only the INOUT and OUT variables. \nModifying IN variables in the script has no impact outside the script. \nVariables can be bound to a Maximo artifact including a mbo attribute, a maxvar, and a maximo system property or \ncan be bound to a literal value which is not related to any Maximo artifact. \nVariables bound to a maxvar or a system property are always IN variables as the script cannot modify them.\nVariable data type for mbo attributes is driven by the mbo attribute datatype. \nFor example, a variable bound to Purchase Order MBOs totalcost attribute will inherit its type. \nVariables bound to maxvar and system properties are always String variables. \nYou can define the data type of variables bound to literal values by specifying “literaldatatype” attribute in the autoscriptvars \ntable. The supported literal data types are ALN, INTEGER, SMALLINT, DECIMAL, YORN, DATETIME, and FLOAT. \nYou can define variable bindings at the script level or the launch point level if the definition at the script level \nallows override of that value at the launch point level.  \nAnother important aspect of the OUT and INOUT variables is how their values can be set back to the MBOs. \nYou can set MBO attributes with the NOACTION flag, which determines if modifying the value of the MBO attribute will call the field validations action routine. \nYou can also set MBO attributes with the NOVALIDATION flag, which determines if modifying the value of the MBO attribute will call the field validations validate routine. \nYou can use MBO atributes to set the NOACCESSCHECK flags, which determine if the Action/Validation routine of the MBO attributes are called. \nYou can set an MBO attribute with any combination of these flags. You can enable these settings from the script or launch point creation wizards and Automation Script application.\n\n\n![Attribute Metadata](attrmeta.jpg)  \n\n\nThe following table explains their usage:  \n\n\n|Binding metadata|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|Suppress Validation|Boolean|MBO attributes will be set with the NOVALIDATION flag, which determines if modifying the value of the MBO attribute will call the field validations validate routine (false) or not call the field validations validate routine (true).|For attribute bindings|\n|Suppress Action|Boolean|MBO attributes will be set with the NOACTION flag, which determines if modifying the value of the MBO attribute will call the field validations validate routine (false) or not call the field validations validate routine (true).|For attribute bindings|\n|Suppress Access Control|Boolean|MBO attributes will be set with the NOACCESSCHECK flag, which determines if the MBO attribute value can be modified irrespective of whether the attribute is readonly (true) or not (true/false).|For attribute bindings|\n\n\n## Implicit and explicit variables\nAnother important feature of scripting is implicit and explicit variables.\nExplicit variables are explicitly defined and bound in the variables page. Implicit variables are not explicitly defined in the variables page and are provided to you behind the scenes by the\nframework. Implicit variables follow the convention over configuration pattern where the\nframework will intelligently inject variables at run time which might otherwise\nhave needed JAVA coding to fetch and set. Some implicit are injected\nbased on how the explicit variables are defined and some are injected irrespectively. The following table lists and describes implicit variables.\n\n|Name|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|app|String|The name of the Maximo application which initiated the script execution.|All launch points dealing with an MBO or MBOSET|\n|user|String|`userid` of the user whose action initiated the script execution.|All launch points dealing with an MBO or MBOSET|\n|mbo|psdi.mbo.Mbo|The current MBO in the context of the script execution.

The following table describes the implicit variables that are based on explicitly defined variables \nwhose binding type is an MBO attribute. There are no implicit variables for explicitly defined variables of other\nbinding types like Literals, Maxvars, and System properties. The assumption is that “var” \nis the explicitly defined variable that binds to an MBO attribute.\n\n\n|Name|Type|Description|Applicability|\n|:-----------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|\n|var_required|boolean|Required flag of the MBO attribute that var binds to.|All launch points.

The script cannot modify it.|\n\n\n## Launch points and callbacks\n**Launch points** are application customization points.\nLaunch points define which application artifact the user wants to customize by\nattaching the script to that point. In effect, the script is executed in the\ncontext of a launch point. For example, if you want to customize the Asset\nMBO's initialization routine, use the key words Asset MBO & initialization routine. Another example is if you want to\ncustomize the Asset MBO's purchaseprice attribute field validation routine. The key words that define the launch point are - Asset MBO, purchaseprice\nattribute, and field validation routine. Essentially, a launch point is a\nconfiguration to identify the application point to customize. A\nscript can be associated with one or more launch points simultaneously. For\nexample, a generic site-level validation script can be associated with all site level\nobjects where each association is defined as an individual\nlaunch point. \nA script can be associated with a single launch point. For example, a script associated with the Object launch point cannot be\nassociated again with another attribute launch point. After the first association is\nCompleted between a script and a launch point – all subsequent launch points have to\nbe the same type as the first.\n\nThe following launch points are currently supported by the scripting framework:\n\n- MBO initialization and save point logic or Object launch point\n- MBO attribute value modification – validation and action logic or Object\nattribute launch point\n- Actions, which are used by many other components like\nWorkflow, Escalation, UI Menu, UI Buttons or Action launch point\n- Custom conditions used by Workflow conditions, Conditional UI and others or custom condition launch point.\n\n**Note:** Launch points and callbacks are the first artifacts to consider when customizing an\napplication.\n\n\n## Activating and deactivating scripts\n\nScripts can be activated or deactivated from the **Launch Point** tab of the Automation Scripting\napplication or from the Script main page. The deactivation from the main script will deactivate the script for all launch points of that script. \nDeactivating from launch point only deactivates that particular launch point. All other active launch points should continue working as usual.\n\n\nMaximo will not invoke a deactivated script. For example, if an Attribute launch point is deactivated, the script for that launch point\nwill not be invoked if the value of that MBO attribute changes. Activating and deactivating scripts is a very useful tool for debugging issues with the\napplication behavior and can take the script out of the equation temporarily to test the application without customization. The autoscript status attribute value has no significance on how the scripting framework will or will not invoke the script.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"983311ffb9ce79886690a7c927fe3579","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":180},"frontmatter":{"title":"Scripting artifacts"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Scripting artifacts\n---\n\n## Script/Launch point creation\nScript and Launch point creation are done using wizards that are available from the **List** tab in the Automation Script application.

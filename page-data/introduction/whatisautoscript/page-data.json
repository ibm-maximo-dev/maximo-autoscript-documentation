The scripting framework can handle various events, including attribute modifications, object modifications, and callbacks. These events and callbacks help script developers target the right extension points for their custom feature. The code and the associated configuration are stored in Maximo Manage database, and the compiled scripts are cached at run time. \n\n### Understanding scripts\nA script is a text file that you can edit in an editor of your choice. Every script has an associated attribute that specifies a script language, which determines the appropriate script engine to process the script. \n\nThe value list for available script languages comes from script engine inputs in the classpath. It is common for script engines to use multiple names for the engine language support. For example, the Jython engine uses two names, Jython and Python, which refer to the same engine and script language. Both names result in an identical outcome. Most engines support script compilation, which eventually converts the script to an executable bytecode for the Java virtual machine. \n\nMaximo Manage supports JavaScript and Jython compiled scripts. When the deployer commits the design process, the framework compiles and caches the script in the background. This process creates scripts that are ready to execute. \n\nNote: If the compile process fails, the process will not commit, and the deployer must fix the script to proceed.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"20b6a72e3005bcfcef1f02bad3bb7b11","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":184},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is an Automation Script"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: What is an Automation Script\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nAn automation script is code that is interpreted and executed at run time by the Maximo Manage scripting framework when a target event happens.

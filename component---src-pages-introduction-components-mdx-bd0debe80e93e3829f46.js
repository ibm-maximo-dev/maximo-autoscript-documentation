One thing to\nnote here is the autoscript status attribute value has no significance as to how the scripting framework will ","[or will not]"," invoke the script."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},4295:function(t,e,a){a.d(e,{Z:function(){return v}});var i=a(7294),n=a(8650),r=a.n(n),o=a(5444),l=a(6949),s=a(3293),p=a(5900),d=a.n(p),c=function(t){var e,a=t.title,n=t.theme,r=t.tabs,o=void 0===r?[]:r;return i.createElement("div",{className:d()("PageHeader-module--page-header--NqfPe",(e={},e["PageHeader-module--with-tabs--vbQ-W"]=o.length,e["PageHeader-module--dark-mode--WCeH8"]="dark"===n,e))},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--grid"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--row"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--col-lg-12"},i.createElement("h1",{id:"page-title",className:"PageHeader-module--text--Er2EO"},a)))))},h=function(t){var e=t.relativePagePath,a=t.repository,n=(0,o.useStaticQuery)("1364590287").site.siteMetadata.repository,r=a||n,l=r.baseUrl,s=r.subDirectory,p=l+"/edit/"+r.branch+s+"/src/pages"+e;return l?i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--row EditLink-module--row--BEmSX"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--col"},i.createElement("a",{className:"EditLink-module--link--IDrl1",href:p},"Edit this page on GitHub"))):null},m=a(4275),b=a(1721),u=function(t){function e(){return t.apply(this,arguments)||this}return(0,b.Z)(e,t),e.prototype.render=function(){var t=this.props,e=t.title,a=t.tabs,n=t.slug,l=n.split("/").filter(Boolean).slice(-1)[0],s=a.map((function(t){var e,a=r()(t,{lower:!0,strict:!0}),s=a===l,p=new RegExp(l+"/?(#.*)?$"),c=n.replace(p,a);return i.createElement("li",{key:t,className:d()((e={},e["PageTabs-module--selected-item--aBB0K"]=s,e),"PageTabs-module--list-item--024o6")},i.createElement(o.Link,{className:"PageTabs-module--link--Kz-7R",to:""+c},t))}));return i.createElement("div",{className:"PageTabs-module--tabs-container--Cdfzw"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--grid"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--row"},i.createElement("div",{className:"bx--col-lg-12 bx--col-no-gutter"},i.createElement("nav",{"aria-label":e},i.createElement("ul",{className:"PageTabs-module--list--xLqxG"},s))))))},e}(i.Component),f=u,A=a(2881),g=a(6958),k=a(36),N=function(t){var e=t.date,a=new Date(e);return e?i.createElement(k.X2,{className:"last-modified-date-module--row--XJoYQ"},i.createElement(k.sg,null,i.createElement("div",{className:"last-modified-date-module--text--ogPQF"},"Page last updated: ",a.toLocaleDateString("en-GB",{day:"2-digit",year:"numeric",month:"long"})))):null},v=function(t){var e=t.pageContext,a=t.children,n=t.location,p=t.Title,d=e.frontmatter,b=void 0===d?{}:d,u=e.relativePagePath,k=e.titleType,v=b.tabs,y=b.title,w=b.theme,x=b.description,E=b.keywords,T=b.date,M=(0,g.Z)().interiorTheme,C=(0,o.useStaticQuery)("2456312558").site.pathPrefix,I=C?n.pathname.replace(C,""):n.pathname,S=v?I.split("/").filter(Boolean).slice(-1)[0]||r()(v[0],{lower:!0}):"",O=w||M;return i.createElement(s.Z,{tabs:v,homepage:!1,theme:O,pageTitle:y,pageDescription:x,pageKeywords:E,titleType:k},i.createElement(c,{title:p?i.createElement(p,null):y,label:"label",tabs:v,theme:O}),v&&i.createElement(f,{title:y,slug:I,tabs:v,currentTab:S}),i.createElement(A.Z,{padded:!0},a,i.createElement(h,{relativePagePath:u}),i.createElement(N,{date:T})),i.createElement(m.Z,{pageContext:e,location:n,slug:I,tabs:v,currentTab:S}),i.createElement(l.Z,null))}}}]);
